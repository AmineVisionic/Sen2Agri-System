The Sentinel-2 for Agriculture system is designed to automatically generate key products for agriculture monitoring, based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data (cloud-free surface reflectance composite, dynamic cropland mask, cultivated crop type map and vegetation indicators describing the vegetative development of crops).
 
It was developed through the Sentinel-2 for Agriculture project, which has been funded by the  European Space Agency ([DUE program](http://due.esrin.esa.int/)).
